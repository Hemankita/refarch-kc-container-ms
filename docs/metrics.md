The fleetms microservice is generating simulated container metrics events to emulate the container on ship. But this project will add capabilities to generate a lot of data to create training and test set for machine learning exercises for predictive maintentane and cold chain scoring.

## Data set creation for container metrics

As we are not in the business of reefer container shipment we do not have data set.
