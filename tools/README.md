## to create data set
We do not have real-world reefer container metrics. So, we are creating the dataset with certain assumptions as below:

In this ection, we discuss our strategy on how we generate datset in three scenarios, which we are considering at this point in time.

1. When the door of the reefer container is open



2. When there is a sensor malfunction (or sensors are incorrectly calibrated)


3. When the reefer conatiner is functioning as expected (baseline/groundtruth for our model)



## To publish containerCreated event.
