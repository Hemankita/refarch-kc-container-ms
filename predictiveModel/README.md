# Predictive maintainence for reefer containers
A reefer container is a refrigerated shipping container used to store or transport frozen or cold goods perishable items or goods that require temperature control. Reefers make an excellent, portable solution to short or long term storage and can be used to ship or truck goods over long distances as they can be plugged into the power station on ships or have clip on generators attached.

Perishable products must be kept at a controlled temperature, from point of origin to delivery to retailer or pharmacy. The logistics industry refers to this as the “cold chain” and it encompasses both “reefers” (refrigerated containers) as well as warehouses, distribution centers and the final storage or holding areas. 

Throughout this chain the risk of failure is ever-present, meaning there is always a possibility of cargo exceeding permissible or safe temperature levels, even if only briefly. For example, a truck might be stopped without power in desert heat, allowing temperatures in the reefer to rise. Then power is restored and the temperature in the container comes back down, but the product is damaged.

In this section, we have a model trained to predict whether maintainence is required for the reefer container.

## Getting Started

The model uses the generated data from three scenarios: 1) when the container's door is open for a longer time - this gives a false positive that maintainence is required 2) when sensors are malfunctioning, it records arbitrary readings, 3) when the readings are normal. We have currently trained our model on 3000 datapoints from the three scenarios above. 

### Code execution
The simulator continuosly generates container metrics, publishes it to Kafka and run the predictMaintainence.ipynb to predict if maintainence is sought at this point in time. 

## Dataset

We do not have datset for reefer containers now. We have manually created the training and testing data. The container metrics generated by the simulator is also manually created. The dataset has the following format.=========================Timestamp, ID, Temperature(celsius), Target_Temperature(celsius), Amp, CumulativePowerConsumption, ContentType, Humidity, CO2, Door_Open,Maintainence_Required, Defrost_Cycle=====================

## Model description

We are using Machine Learning Linear Regression here. There are two types of supervised learning - 1) Classification: Predict a categorical response, 2) Regression: Predict a continuous response

Linear regression Pros and Cons
Pros: 1) Fast 2) No tuning required 3) Highly interpretable 4) Well-understood

Cons: 1) Unlikely to produce the best predictive accuracy 2) Presumes a linear relationship between the features and response 3) If the relationship is highly non-linear as with many scenarios, linear relationship will not effectively model the relationship and its prediction would not be accurate

## Model evaluation

We are using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluating the model performance.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors.
